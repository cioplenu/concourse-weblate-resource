# Weblate Concourse Resource

A simple [resource]() for [Concourse CI]() to interact with a [Weblate]() server. It uses the [wlc cli client]() to interact with the Weblate server to perform simple repository commands like _push_, _pull_, _lock_ or _unlock_.

This is still a work in progress. Feel free to contribute fixes and more features or open an issue but don't expect immediate support. This resource is not an official project of the Weblate or Concourse team.
